# NOTE: All external links pointing at the developer site (for example to sphinx docs)
#       need to begin with a space character in order to indicate to the i18n system that
#       those links shouldn't be magically turned into i18n equivalents for non-english 
#       languages. For more info, see https://github.com/untra/polyglot#disabling-url-relativizing
