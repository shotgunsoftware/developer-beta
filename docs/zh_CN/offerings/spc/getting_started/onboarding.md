# Onboarding Process

Shotgun Private Cloud is an enterprise level offering that requires adopters to become AWS users. In order to ensure that this joint venture between Shotgun, AWS, and our clients is as streamlines as possible, we decided to work closely with Amazon to define a cooperative onboarding process that would meet client expectations for a premium offering.

Shotgun and Amazon will provide dedicated resources during the onboarding process to help you on this journey.

# Onboarding Process Overview

**Tech Briefing:**  Overview meeting of all of our offerings, where we underline the advantages and disadvantages of each.

**Tech Deep Dive:**  OPTIONAL. Deeper technical dive into Shotgun Private Cloud. This meeting can be combined with the Tech Briefing.

# Onboarding Resources

**Shotgun Community:** The [Shotgun Private Cloud Community](https://community.shotgunsoftware.com/c/beta-private-cloud/31) forum can be used to ask questions that can be answered by either Shotgun Experts or other Shotgun Private Cloud users. This should be your first stop when asking general questions about Shotgun Private Cloud, during setup and beyond.

**Private Slack Channel:** During the onboarding, you will be given access to a dedicated Autodesk Slack Channel. Your Shotgun and AWS Leaders will be available for quick feedback, answers, and ad-hoc meetings to help you progress as fast as possible with your Shotgun Private Cloud setup. This channel will be available only for the onboarding period.

**Shotgun Support:** A [Shotgun Support](https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) ticket will be used to track your onboarding at a higher level. Once your Shotgun Private Cloud setup is complete, follow-up support tickets can be opened with the support team as needed.
