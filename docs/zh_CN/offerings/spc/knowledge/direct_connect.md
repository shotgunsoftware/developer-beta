# Direct Connect

[AWS Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/) is a service from AWS that allows you to establish a dedicated connection from your on-premise data center (or offices) to AWS. Direct Connect will allow you to create a dedicated link between your network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.

Shotgun Private Cloud leverages AWS Direct Connect to ensure a dedicated link is created between your studio (via your private VPC) and our infrastructure in AWS.
