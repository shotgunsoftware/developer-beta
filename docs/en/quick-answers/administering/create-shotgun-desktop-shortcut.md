# How do I set up a desktop/launcher icon for Shotgun Desktop on Linux?

## Question:

After I run the Shotgun Desktop installer on Linux, no launch icons appear on the desktop or on any menu. How do I add those?

## Answer:

The current Shotgun Desktop installer doesn't automatically create shortcuts and launch entries, so you have to manually go in and do this afterwards. It's straight forward and may differ depending on which flavour of Linux you are using. 

Once you have run the Shotgun desktop installer, the Shotgun Desktop executable will be located in the /opt/Shotgun folder. The name of the executable is Shotgun.
No icon is distributed with the installer, instead please download it from the Shotgun Desktop engine github repository.
Once you have dowloaded the icon and have the path to the executable (/opt/Shotgun/Shotgun), please manually create any desktop or menu launchers you may require. The process for doing this varies depending on the version of Linux, but you can typically create a desktop launcher by right clicking on the Desktop and looking for a suitable menu option there.
