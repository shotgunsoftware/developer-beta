# Shotgun Private Cloud
Shotgun Private Cloud is a hybrid cloud solution that satisfies strict security and legal requirements, while minimizing Shotgun System Admin specific required knowledge and maintenance. Shotgun Private Cloud allows you to stay in control of sensitive content, while removing the need to host the service on your own infrastructure.

When you use Shotgun Private Cloud, you isolate sensitive content from the Public Internet, allowing you to meet security requirements that may not be met by the Shotgun Cloud standard offering.
