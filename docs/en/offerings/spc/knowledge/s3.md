# S3

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is an object storage service offered by AWS. It can be thought of as a highly durable storage space in the cloud. Shotgun uses S3 to store uploaded media and files.

 Clients using Shotgun Private Cloud bring their own S3 buckets and configure Shotgun to use it for storage. Please refer to our [S3 Bucket setup article](../setup/s3_bucket.md) for details on how to do that.
