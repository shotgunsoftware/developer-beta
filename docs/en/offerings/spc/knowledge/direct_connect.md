# Direct Connect

[AWS Direct connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/) is a service from AWS that allows clients to establish a dedicated connection from their on-premise data centers, or offices to AWS. Direct Connect will allow clients to create a dedicated link between their network and one of the AWS Direct Connect locations.

Shotgun Private Cloud leverages AWS Direct Connect to ensure a dedicated link is created between client studios (via their private VPC) and our infrastructure in AWS.
