# Onboarding Process

Shotgun Private Cloud is an enterprise level offering that requires adopters to become AWS users. In order to make sure this joint venture between Shotgun, AWS and our clients is as streamlines as possible, we decided to work closely with Amazon to define a cooperative onboarding process that would meet client expectations for a premium offering.

Shotgun and Amazon will provide dedicated resources during the on-boarding process to help you in this journey.

# Onboarding Process Overview
