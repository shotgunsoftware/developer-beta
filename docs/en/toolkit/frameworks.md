# Toolkit Frameworks

Toolkit frameworks are collections of code that can be used across apps and engines. You can read more about the frameworks in general [in our core API documentation](https://developer.shotgunsoftware.com/tk-core/platform.html#frameworks).

We also provide some pre made frameworks which you can use in your tools.

The [**Shotgun Utilities Framework**](https://developer.shotgunsoftware.com/tk-framework-qtwidgets/), or `tk-framework-shotgunutils`, is a collection of Shotgun-related helpers and utilities that make App development easier. It includes a Shotgun (MVC) Model, which makes it easy to connect a Shotgun query with a standard QT View, as well as classes for managing settings, background Shotgun processing, and globals such as schema, statuses, and icons.

The [**QT Widgets Framework**](https://developer.shotgunsoftware.com/tk-framework-shotgunutils/), or `tk-framework-qtwidgets`, is a large collection of Shotgun-related QT widgets that make it easy to quickly build a nice looking front-end to your App. It includes multiple custom QT views, delegates, and widgets.
