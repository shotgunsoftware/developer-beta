# Toolkit Frameworks

Toolkit frameworks are collections of code that can be used across apps and engines. The Shotgun Utilities and QT Widgets frameworks are especially useful in app development.

## Shotgun Utilities Framework

The **Shotgun Utilities Framework**, or `tk-framework-shotgunutils`, is a collection of Shotgun-related helpers and utilities that make App development easier. It includes a Shotgun (MVC) Model, which makes it easy to connect a Shotgun query with a standard QT View, as well as classes for managing settings, background Shotgun processing, and globals such as schema, statuses, and icons.

## QT Widgets Framework

The **QT Widgets Framework**, or `tk-framework-qtwidgets`, is a large collection of Shotgun-related QT widgets that make it easy to quickly build a nice looking front-end to your App. It includes multiple custom QT views, delegates, and widgets.
