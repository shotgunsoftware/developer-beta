# Toolkit Basics Guides

Shotgun Toolkit provides a set of highly customizable tools for creating studio pipelines where artists can access info from Shotgun and share their work with each other, without ever leaving their content creation software. These guides are designed to get you started with setting up your custom Toolkit pipeline via hands-on exercises: you'll use the Shotgun Desktop app to generate an editable configuration for your project, modify settings on existing apps, and even add Toolkit apps to different artist environments, getting you on the path to designing your custom pipeline. Each guide builds on the ones before it, but they include instructions for jumping in from anywhere.
