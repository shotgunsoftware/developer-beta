The {% include product %} engine for the shell handles command line interaction and is tightly integrated with the `tank` command which is distributed as part of the Core API. When you execute the `tank` command in a terminal, Toolkit launches the engine to handle app execution.

For more information about the `tank` command, please see our main documentation:
