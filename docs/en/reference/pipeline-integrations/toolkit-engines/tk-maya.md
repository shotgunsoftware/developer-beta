# Maya

The {% include product %} engine for Maya contains a standard platform for integrating {% include product %} Apps into Maya. It is lightweight and straight forward and adds a {% include product %} menu to the Maya menu bar.

## Maya Project Management

Whenever the {% include product %} engine for Maya starts, it will set the Maya Project to point at a location defined in the settings for this engine. This means that the Project may also change when a new file is opened. The details relating to how the maya project is set based on a file can be configured in the configuration file, using the template system.
