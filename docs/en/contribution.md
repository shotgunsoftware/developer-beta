# Contribution Guide

In our efforts to work as openly as possible, we have decided to build our developer documentation in a public repository under a (https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/developer-beta/blob/master/LICENSE.md)[Creative Commons license]. If you see a way to make this documentation better, we would love to get a pull request for the repo with improvements. In order to accept a pull request, we need to have one of the following contributor agreements signed by you:

- (contribution/ind_contrib_agmt_for_shotgun_developer_documentation.pdf)[Individual Contribution Agreement]
- (contribution/corp_contrib_agmt_for_shotgun_developer_documentation.pdf)[Corporate Contribution Agreement]

Once you have submitted one of the above agreements, you can follow the instructions in the (https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/developer-beta/#making-a-change-to-developershotgunsoftwarecom)[README] on how to submit a change.
