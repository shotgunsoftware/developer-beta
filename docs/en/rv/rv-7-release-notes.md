# RV 7 Release Notes

**CAVEATS**

* **IMPORTANT:** Effective from RV 7.2.x onwards, support for Nvidia SDI is removed.
* **KNOWN ISSUE:** The use of LUTs with GLSL shaders under certain scenarios will render black frames.
* To use RV/RVSDI on OSX 10.12 (Sierra), RV/RVSDI 7.1.1 or later is required. If a version of RV prior to 7.1.1 was run on OSX 10.12, it is likely that your RV preferences now contain invalid values. We suggest resetting your preferences with *-resetPrefs* when you run an OSX 10.12 supported version of RV for the first time on OSX 10.12.
* These notes list all changes since RV 4.2.4. Complete release notes from the previous RV4 release series are also available.
