# H: Crash Reporting

RV includes googleâ€™s crash reporting mechanism called breakpad on Linux. If RV crashes it will produce a file in /tmp with an extension of .dmp. This file can be sent to our support email and used to determine exactly how the program crashed.

If you see one of these files please send it to us along with the version of rv which crashed.
