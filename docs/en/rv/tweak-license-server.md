# Tweak License Server (tlm_server) Version 2.6

Â© [Tweak Software](http://tweaksoftware.com/)

## Audience

The License Server should be installed by a System Administrator or someone who is knowledgeable about how system processes work on your platform.

## Overview

The Tweak License Server is capable of managing an arbitrary number of applications purchased from Tweak Software. If a network connection exists between a client and the server, and a valid license matching the client software is present, the server will grant the client permission to run the desired application. Managing license count, type, and function is all done transparently to the user. The Tweak License Server is most commonly run as a system service, but can also be run explicitly as a foreground or background process.
