# A: Open Source Components

RV uses components licensed under the GNU LGPL and other open-source licenses. There is no GPL code in any of RV’s binaries. LGPL code for which Tweak Software (or Tweak Films) is the copyright holder is sometimes directly compiled into RV (not as a shared library).

Tweak Software takes open source licensing seriously. Open source software can have huge social benefits and we ourselves have benefited from the work of open source developers. We have in the past contributed, time, code and funding to open source projects and will continue to do so in the future.

## GTO

The session file (.rv) is a form of GTO file. The GTO file library is distributed under the terms similar to the BSD license and is available from our website. The GTO format was invented and is copyrighted by Tweak Films.

The GTO source distribution includes a handful of tools to edit GTO files independently of any application. Also included is a Python module which makes editing the files extremely easy.

RV ships with prebuilt versions of GTO command line tools.

## Libquicktime

RV can use libquicktime which is distributed under the terms of the GNU LGPL to read and write QuickTime, dv, MP4, and AVI movie files. The libquicktime library can be found in $RV_HOME/lib as a shared object. Libquicktime is capable of reading codecs not shipped with RV. You can read documentation at the libquicktime website to find out how to write or install new codecs. Plugin codecs can be found in $RV_HOME/plugins/lqt in the RV distribution tree. New codecs can be installed in the same location.

Source code for libquicktime and the plugins used by RV is included with the RV distribution.

## FFMPEG

On Linux, RV uses an LGPL-only version of FFMPEG by itself and as a libquicktime plugin to decode H.264 video and AAC audio. Source code for FFMPEG is included with RV. We build FFMPEG with the flags generated by its configure script, but we do not use its make files. RV (via the ffmpeg libquicktime plugin) uses only a small portion of FFMPEG. These portions are restricted to the codecs for which Tweak Software has a license – namely the AVC1 (H.264) video and AAC audio codecs for decoding only (the MPEG4 codecs generally).

If you are using ffmpeg through our ffmpeg plugin directly then you can find directions in $RV_HOME/src/mio_ffmpeg/README for recompiling with support for additional codecs ffmpeg supports. The obligation is yours, however, to sort out licensing if doing so.

## FreeType

RV uses FreeType for rendering text on the image view.

## FTGL

Copyright (c) 2001-2004 Henry Maddocks <ftgl@opengl.geek.nz>.

## LibRaw

This software uses LibRaw (libraw.org) to decode some raw camera file formats.

## Libtiff

RV uses version 3.10.0 of libtiff as to read and write TIFF files and EXIF jpeg metadata.
