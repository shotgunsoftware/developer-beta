# Extending Protocols or the File Format

If you have an extension to a protocol or would like to change an existing protocol, we would like to hear about it. You can send mail to with the changes you’re using or would like made. We will collect ideas and proposals and try to make releases in a timely manner. We’d also like to hear from you if you’re using it unmodified.

There is currently a small number of facilities that use the GTO format, but there is a large collection of tools that use it. Most proposals should maintain some backwards compatibility. However, we recognize that the there may be flaws that require revamping significant pieces and we’re open to making changes to accommodate other facilities.

If you are using the format for academic purposes and are looking for a specific tool to munge GTO files, we may already have that tool even though it is not released. Contact us; we might be able to help you out.

We have been using the format since summer 2002 on a regular basis in production at Tweak Films and have found it stable and useful. The version of the code we use is identical to the released version.
