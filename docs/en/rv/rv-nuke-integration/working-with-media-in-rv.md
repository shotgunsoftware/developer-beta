# Working with Media in RV

There’s lots of useful info online on this topic in the RV User Manual. Particularly relevant here is the chapter on the Session Manager and the section on navigation.

## Folders

Folders are new in RV 3.10.9 and open up lots of organizational possibilities. The Nuke integration makes use of Folders to organize your media. You’ll have a folder for all your Read nodes, a folder of checkpoints and renders for each rendered node, and a catch-all folder called “Other” to collect the rest. All folders are viewable and make for a handy “browsing” interface.

## Comparisons

You can easily Compare two or more renders or checkpoints (or any views, actually). Just select the views of interest in the Session Managerand select on the comparison items on RV’s *Nuke* menu: *Nuke/Wipe Selected Views* or *Nuke/Tile Selected Views*.
