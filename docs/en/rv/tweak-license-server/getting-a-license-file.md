# Getting a License File

The Tweak License Server requires a license file generated by Tweak Software in order to operate. The license will be keyed to the hostID of the machine the server is running on. The procedure for getting a license is:

1. Find the local Hardware ID (MAC address). There are a number of ways to obtain a Hardware Address for the machine you would like to host the Tweak License Server. The license server package contains a program called `tlm_hostid` that will list valid Hardware IDs. The best choice is the ID from a system component, like an on-board NIC used for et0\. On a linux machine, the command `/sbin/ifconfig` passed with the parameter of the machineâ€™s net- work card (eth0) will yield the HWaddr. On OS X, `ifconfig` will also work - or you use the Network Preferences to find the *Ethernet ID.* The Hardware ID should look something like this: 00:E0:81:25:C8:82.

**Note** that on many systems there will be several IDs since there are several network interfaces. In these cases any one of them should work.

2. Email the Hardware ID to Tweak.

3. Install the License File. The tweak license file can reside anywhere the License Server host can see. It may be easiest to place it in the same directory.
