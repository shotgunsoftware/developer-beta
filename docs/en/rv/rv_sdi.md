# RV-SDI Manual

This manual describes Tweakâ€™s implementation of the NVIDIA SDI video device as a presentation mode device. For more information on presentation mode and how it relates to RV in general, see the RV User Manual. To use RV-SDI, you must run the `rv` (or `rv.exe`) executable, and have an `rvsdi` license.
