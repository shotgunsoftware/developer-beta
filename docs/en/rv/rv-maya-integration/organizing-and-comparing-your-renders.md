# Organizing and Comparing your Renders

By default, each new playblast that Maya adds to your session will become the current view. Note that you can easily switch back and forth between this Render and the previous one with the *shift-left/right-arrow* keys.

The “default” views (see the Session Manager) also let you easily see all your playblasts in a Sequence, in a Layout, or arranged in a Stack (note that you can use the “()” keys to easily cycle the stack, or you can use drag-and-drop in the Inputs section of the Session Manger to easily rearrange a group view.

If you’d like to “stick” to the view you’ve chosen, instead of switching to each new playblast as it arrives, toggle the *View Latest Playblast* option off on the *Maya* menu in RV.
