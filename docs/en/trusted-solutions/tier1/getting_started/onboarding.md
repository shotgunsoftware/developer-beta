# Onboarding Process

Leveraging the isolation features requires adopters to become AWS users. In order to ensure that this joint venture between Autodesk, AWS, and our clients is as streamlines as possible, we decided to work closely with AWS to define a cooperative onboarding process that would meet client expectations for a premium offering.

Autodesk and Amazon will provide dedicated resources during the onboarding process to help you on this journey.

# Onboarding Process Overview

During the onboarding process, you'll have direct access to Autodesk and AWS Leaders who will support you during the implementation.

**Tech Briefing:**  Overview meeting of all of our offerings, where we underline the advantages and disadvantages of each.

**Tech Deep Dive:**  OPTIONAL. Deeper technical dive into isolation features. This meeting can be combined with the Tech Briefing.

**Pre-qualification:** Qualification, from a technical point of view. Determine what the implications will be of choosing one offering over another.

**Offering Selection:** Here, you will select the offering that best suits you, under Tech Sales guidance.

**Kickoff Meeting:**	AWS and Shotgun Leaders review the setup process with the you.

**Setup / Test / Validation:**	Iterative installation process where you connect your AWS resources to Shotgun, and activate the isolation features.

**Training:** OPTIONAL. Help sessions, if needed, as you ramp up on the AWS/Shotgun technologies required to securely set-up the isolation features for your site.

# Onboarding Resources

**Shotgun Community:** The [Shotgun Isolation Community](https://community.shotgunsoftware.com/c/trusted-solutions/isolation/34) forum can be used to ask questions that can be answered by either Shotgun Experts or other isolation features users. This should be your first stop when asking general questions about isolation features, during setup and beyond.

**Private Slack Channel:** During the onboarding, you will be given access to a dedicated Autodesk Slack Channel. Your Shotgun and AWS Leaders will be available for quick feedback, answers, and ad-hoc meetings to help you progress as fast as possible with your Shotgun Isolation setup. This channel will be available only for the onboarding period.

**Shotgun Support:** A [Shotgun Support](https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) ticket will be used to track your onboarding at a higher level. Once your Shotgun Isolation setup is complete, follow-up support tickets can be opened with the support team as needed.
